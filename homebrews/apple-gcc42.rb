      NOTE:
      This formula provides components that were removed from XCode in the 4.2
      release. There is no reason to install this formula if you are using a
      version of XCode prior to 4.2.

      This formula contains compilers built from Apple's GCC sources, build
      5666.3, available from:

        http://opensource.apple.com/tarballs/gcc

      All compilers have a `-4.2` suffix. A GFortran compiler is also included
      and is the exact same version as the compiler provided by the `gfortran`
      formula in the main repository.
